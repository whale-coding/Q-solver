## 📖 Introduction

**Q-Solver** is a desktop AI assistant tailored for written tests and efficient multitasking. It deeply integrates top-tier LLMs like **OpenAI**, **Google Gemini**, and **Anthropic Claude**. With minimal screenshot interactions, it provides real-time code analysis, Q&A, and content creation assistance.

Unlike traditional chatbots, Q-Solver features unique capabilities such as **Reasoning Chain Visualization**, **Stealth/Anti-Recording Mode**, and **Resume Context Awareness**, seamlessly blending into your workflow as a truly "understanding" AI assistant.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🛡️ Stealth Mode
Designed for high-focus or written test environments. When activated:
- **Borderless / Semi-Transparent**: Floats perfectly above other windows.
- **Anti-Focus Stealing**: Does not auto-hide when operating other software; answers remain visible.
- **Anti-Screen Recording**: Special window attributes to evade some screen capture and recording detection.
- **Click-Through**: Click through the window to interact with the application behind it.

### 🔌 Comprehensive Model Support
- **Native SDK Integration**: Built-in native SDKs for Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and OpenAI (not just HTTP forwarding) to ensure optimal streaming response and stability.
- **Custom Access**: Supports aggregation services like OneAPI for flexible network adaptation.

### 📄 Context & Resume Awareness
- **Resume Assistant**: Import PDF/Markdown resumes, and the AI generates personalized answers based on your background (ideal for mock interviews and resume polishing).
- **Smart Memory**: Supports multi-turn conversation context, automatically clearing when a new topic starts.

### 🎙️ Gemini Live API (Experimental)
- **Real-time Voice Conversation**: Supports bidirectional real-time voice calls with Gemini models, providing an ultra-low latency interaction experience.
- **Interviewer Mode**: Simulates real technical interview scenarios, transcribing interviewer questions in real-time, with AI providing instant answer suggestions.
- **Note**: This feature is currently in an **experimental stage**. Connection instability or audio interruptions may occur due to network conditions.
- **Supported Models**: Please select `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`.

### ⚡ Extreme Performance
- **Go + Wails**: Modern tech stack with native-level performance and extremely low memory footprint.
- **Vue 3 Frontend**: Responsive, modern UI that is smooth and fluid.
- **Global Shortcuts**: Wake up with `F8` in a split second without switching windows.

## 🍎 macOS Instructions

> ⚠️ **Compatibility Note**: The macOS version is currently in **compatibility adaptation stage** and may have bugs or instability. Please submit an Issue if you encounter any problems!

### Shortcuts
The macOS version supports the following fixed shortcuts. **Customization is not supported yet**:

| Function | Shortcut |
|----------|----------|
| Screenshot & Solve | `⌘1` |
| Show/Hide | `⌘2` |
| Click-Through | `⌘3` |
| Move Window Up | `⌘⌥↑` |
| Move Window Down | `⌘⌥↓` |
| Move Window Left | `⌘⌥←` |

2. Click **Grant Screenshot Permission** button
3. Enable the app in System Preferences
4. Return to the app and click **Refresh Permission Status**

### System Audio Capture (Gemini Live API)
macOS does not natively support recording system audio. You need to install a virtual audio driver:

1. **Install BlackHole** (2-channel version recommended):
   ```bash
   brew install blackhole-2ch
   ```

2. **Configure Multi-Output Device**:
   - Open **Audio MIDI Setup** (Applications > Utilities)
   - Click the **+** button at the bottom left, select **Create Multi-Output Device**
   - Check both **BlackHole 2ch** and your speakers/headphones
   - Right-click the new multi-output device and select **Use This Device For Sound Output**

3. **Grant Microphone Permission**: When launching the Live API feature for the first time, please allow microphone access.

> **Note**: If BlackHole is not installed, the "Interviewer Mode" in Live API will not be able to capture system audio.
